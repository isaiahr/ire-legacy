# ire
this repository contains the source code for irec, the ire compiler.


### what it can do (so far)
  - functions
  - variables
  - type system (partially)
  - imports (very basic)
  - arithmetic
  - conditional branching (if stmt, else not implemented yet)
 
### what will be implemented in the future
  - logical operators (and, or)
  - else, else if
  - enforce type system rules
  - rewrite of import system
  - gc 
  - first class functions
  - lambdas
  - other os support (mac, windows)

irec often crashes on malformed input. I will work to fix this and improve the compiler.
